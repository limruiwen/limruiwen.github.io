Using the slider on the left, you can select the year(s). The blue circles on the map represent the location of the reptile roadkill.

The dataset contains the date, type of animal killed, species, coordinates of where the roadkill was found and path type the roadkill was found on. Project RunOver is based on citizen science. Citizen Scientists are encouraged to send in sightings of reptile roadkill, regardless of vehicle type. Project Runover uses data from 2011 to the present day.\n\n\nIn my data cleaning process, I removed empty rows to ensure accuracy. In addition, in the original dataset, some of the locations were not coordinates, but street names. To aid the crafting of data visualisations, I converted these street names into coordinates.\n\n\nSuch data is important as it helps us understand the impacts urbanisation has on wildlife and the mitigation measures we can take. Some of these species may even be endangered, and Project Runover is one of the ways we can ensure the survival of more precious willdife species!\n\n\nI would like to thank Mr Kannan Raja, Head of the Herpetological Society of Singapore, for giving me access to this dataset."
