# I am Rui Wen, a Y2 Psychology student. I am passionate about nature and wildlife conservation! Recently, a Jungle Fowl collided into the window of the multi-purpose hall of my RC, causing its death. The datasets I provide are thus on bird-window collisions which are often fatal. I hope to raise awareness on this issue to reduce the loss of innocent bird lives.
