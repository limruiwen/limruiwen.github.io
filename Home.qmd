<p> My name is Rui Wen and I am very passionate about wildlife and conservation! My favourite animals are snakes and I love exploring nature and getting to see wildlife! </p>

<p> The inspiration for this project came from two sources. The first source was from the Kukri Snake roadkill I saw in Kaeng Krachan, Thailand. I knelt by the roadside as it took it last breath, head injured by a vehicle collision. </p>

<p> My next source of inspiration came from attending the Death By Man Exhibition by Jasvic Lye. The artist photographed the carcasses of different wildlife that died due to human causes. The exhibition humanises these wildlife through narratives and visuals to raise awareness on the adverse impacts of urbanisation on wildlife. </p>

<p> My project thus aims to bring to light the adverse impacts urbanisation has had on wildlife through examining data from the Herpetological Society of Singapore's Project Runover. </p>
