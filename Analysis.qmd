I am Rui Wen, a Y2 Psychology student. I am passionate about nature and wildlife conservation! The dataset I provide are from the Herpetological Society of Singapore. Their data consists of reports from citizens on reptile roadkill they find. Through analysing this dataset, I hope to raise awareness on the negative impacts of urbanisation on wildlife and conservation.
