## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

\#**(1)** What is the topic that you have finalized?

# I would like to do a data story on bird window collisions to raise awareness on this issue.

-   **(2)** What are the data sources that you have curated so far? (Answer 1 or 2 sentences).

I have curated data from Chicago and Cleveland on the bird building collisions in these states. There is also data on the light levels in these states which could cause glares/reflections off of the windows, increasing bird building collisions
